## PDA evidence 2.7 - interpreting the results of statistical analysis
# do final hypothesis test
t.test(test_summer$total_attendances,
       test_winter$total_attendances,
       alternative = "two.sided",
       paired = FALSE,
       conf.level = 0.95)
```
Interpretation:
Results of the Two sample t-test above show that the calculated p-value is smaller
than the α value:

p-value < α
2.694e-07 < 0.05

This means we can reject H0. We have found enough evidence in our data to suggest 
that total A&E attendances during winter is statistically significantly different
than the A&E attendances during the summer.
