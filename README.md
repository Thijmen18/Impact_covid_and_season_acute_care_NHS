# Impact_covid_and_season_acute_care_NHS 
a.k.a. PHS_penguin_team_project
 
## Project description

The project we are going to describe is a group project we were assigned during our CodeClan course. The group was composed by four people: Thijmen Breeschoten, Chiara Capresi, Naomi Penfold and Alistair Trucco. 

In this project we were asked to provide an analysis  of how acute care provision changes by season (summer versus winter) and with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, using data from Public Health Scotland and NHS Scotland.

**Disclaimer:** this project was not requested by and had no involvement from Public Health Scotland or NHS Scotland, and any results or insights are not intended to be used in real life.

## Process

Our main approach was that of starting with a deep analysis of the data avilable with a view to identifying KPIs that in our opinion might be significant for the client.

Each of us worked separately to the cleaning and wrangling data operations necessary for producing visualisations and explanation for each one of the KPIs we selected during the setting stage, even if we planned regular update stages for sharing with the other group's members new goals, hypothesis and concerns.

From the data available, we were able to explore several key performance indicators (KPIs) of acute care provision, including client intake (A&E attendances and hospital admissions), measures of service workload within the service (wait times in A&E and for hospital treatment, length of stay, bed occupancy), and an outflow metric that affects service capacity and resources (delayed discharge).

_Key indicators of acute care provision included in the available datasets._

To understand the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on three key indicators that cover the flow of clients into, within and out of hospital care: hospital admissions, bed occupancy, and delayed discharge.

To investigate seasonality, we focussed on A&E attendances, because we found a seasonal pattern here (also in A&E wait times) whereas we did not find any seasonality in other indicators.

## About the data
 
This project uses data from Public Health Scotland and NHS Scotland, which contains public sector information licensed under the [Open Government Licence v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

The Shiny dashboard presents data from the following specific datasets: 

* Monthly A&E activity and waiting times: https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/monthly-accident-and-emergency-activity-and-waiting-times  
* COVID-19 Wider Impacts - Hospital Admissions: https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-wider-impacts-hospital-admissions 
* [for occupancy] Beds Information in Scotland: https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/hospital-beds-information 
* Delayed Discharges in NHS Scotland: https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/delayed-discharges-in-nhsscotland
* NHS Scotland Hospital Locations:
https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/hospital-codes/resource/c698f450-eeed-41a0-88f7-c1e40a568acc

Exploration notebooks also include work using these additional datasets:

* Treatment wait times: https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/stage-of-treatment-waiting-times
* Inpatient and day cases activity (including length of stay):
  * Activity by Board of Treatment and Specialty: https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/inpatient-and-daycase-activity/resource/c3b4be64-5fb4-4a2f-af41-b0012f0a276a

## Running the app locally

### Requirements

R packages used over all scripts:

* tidyverse_2.0.0
* ggplot2_3.4.2
* janitor_2.2.0
* lubridate_1.9.2
* bslib_0.4.2 
* plotly_4.10.2
* leaflet_2.1.2
* sf_1.0-13 
* shiny_1.7.4


### How to run the app locally

1. **Download raw data:** download .csv data from websites above 
2. **Prepare cleaned data:** run all 5 cleaning scripts (in any order) - these will write new csvs into data/cleaned_data folder within your project directory, which are required for running the dashboard.
3. **Run the R Shiny dashboard locally:** run one of global, ui, server scripts - the shiny dashboard should load in your web browser

Note we downloaded the raw data files on ~July 7-14 2023. Any updates to the open data webpages since this date may affect whether the cleaning scripts run as expected. (We have not included data validation steps... yet.)
